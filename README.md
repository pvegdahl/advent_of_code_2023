# AdventOfCode2023

My repository for the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenge.  My previous personal best was day 18
in AoC 2021. Let's see if I make it any further this year. Just like last year, I'm planning to use
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/).  However, this year I'm much more experienced with the language.

I created a custom mix task to run the code for specific days.  You can execute it with:

```
mix advent 01 02 ...
```

i.e. give one or more days as inputs.

As usual, you can run the unit tests with `mix test`
